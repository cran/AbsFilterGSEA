Description: Gene-permuting GSEA (or preranked GSEA) generates a lot of false positive gene-sets due to the inter-gene correlation in each gene set. Such false positives can be successfully reduced by filtering with the one-tailed absolute GSEA results. This package provides a function that performs gene-permuting GSEA calculation with or without the absolute filtering.
